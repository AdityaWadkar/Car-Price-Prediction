# Car-Price-Prediction
This repository contains a car price prediction model that is trained to predict the selling price of used cars based on their characteristics. The model is built using a machine learning algorithm and is trained on a dataset of used car information. The repository includes the code for data cleaning, preprocessing, training the model, and evaluating its performance. The goal of this project is to provide a tool that can help car buyers and sellers make informed decisions about pricing.
